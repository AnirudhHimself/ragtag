My personal R project that keeps things like an R markdown template and helper functions that I like to use. 

For an explanation of how to create your own template in R, I'd recommend taking a look at Chapter 18 in Yihui Xie's book [Rmarkdown: The Difinitive Guide]([https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/new-formats.html]
