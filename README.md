My personal R project that keeps things like an R markdown template.

For an explanation of how to create your own Rmarkdown html template in R, I'd recommend taking a look at Chapter 18 in Yihui Xie's book [Rmarkdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/new-formats.html)

In the future, I'd like to store some helper functions that I find myself routinely using here and also a GGplot theme that has the appearance set-up just the way I want.
